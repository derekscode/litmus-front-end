**How to create a new repo using this as a boilerplate**
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10963878/how-do-you-fork-your-own-project-on-github)
- clone the repo
- Delete the .git folder in the root directory
- rename the root folder 
- right-click on root folder > "Open with Code"
- click "Initialize Git Repository"
- do initial commit
- Github.com > New
- Copy 2 lines and paste into command prompt to push local repo to Github
- change readme.md to reflect new repo



**To get started**

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
